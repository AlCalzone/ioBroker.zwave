Then the page is automatically reloaded.\n\nIf you change the Name or Location, it takes 5 seconds. Then the page is automatically reloaded.\n\n## Features\nWithin OpenZWave Configurator you can see all Nodes and their classes.\n\nFollowing Actions are current supported (only with context menu):\n\n- Set Name and Set Location for Node itself\n- Change Value of a class\n\nFollowing global Actions are current supported:\n\n- Add Nodes\n- Remove Nodes\n- Refresh Nodes (Refresh Nodes from ioBroker Communication)\n\n## Todo\n### ZWave Specific\n\n- Scenes\n- Group Management\n- Polling\n- Controller Commands\n- Configuration Commands\n\n### Global\n\n- Test more Hardware\n- Move config and logfile into iobroker default path (/opt/iobroker/log, /opt/iobroker/data/files/zwave)\n- Language Support (English, German, Russian)\n\n## Tested Hardware\n### ZWave\n\n- ZME_UZB1 USB Stick\n- RazBerry GPIO Board for RaspBerry (1/2)\n\n### Fibaro\n\n- FGBS001 Universal Binary Sensor\n- FGS222 Double Relay Switch 2x1.5kW\n- FGWPE Wall Plug\n- FGSS001 Smoke Sensor\n- FGMS001 Motion Sensor\n\n### Danfoss\n\n- Danfoss Living Connect Room Thermostat (type 0003, id 8010)\n- Danfoss Z Thermostat 014G0013\n\n## Changelog\n### 0.4.2 (2016-11-15)\n* (AlCalzone) Read devices from dev and not from serialport\n\n### 0.4.1 (2016-11-14)\n* (AlCalzone) Allow set of parameters\n\n### 0.4.0 (2016-11-01)\n* (bluefox) Rewrite adapter completely\n\n### 0.2.5 (2015-12-21)\n - (husky-koglhof) Objecttree build now on change/added/ready from zwave\n - Default Role/Type/State (needed for history)\n - openzwave-shared 1.1.6\n - last openzwave from github\n - OpenZWave Security\n\n### 0.2.4 (2015-12-05)\n - (husky-koglhof) fixed hardcoded values\n   Admin Page can Add / Remove ZWave Devices\n   \n### 0.2.3 (2015-11-11)\n - (bluefox) try to fix io-package.json\n\n### 0.2.2 (2015-09-28)\n - (ekarak) API changes for openzwave-shared 1.0.8+\n\n### 0.2.3 (2015-11-11)\n - (bluefox) try to fix io-package.json\n\n### 0.2.2 (2015-09-28)\n - (ekarak) API changes for openzwave-shared 1.0.8+\n\n### 0.2.1 (2015-08-24)\n - (husky-koglhof) Fixed Errors with Config save at OpenZwave Configurator\n\n### 0.2.0 (2015-08-05)\n - (husky-koglhof) Added OpenZWave Configurator, changed Dependency from openzwave to openzwave-shared, Implemented stateChange, objectChange Functions, Implemented extended Settings\n \n### 0.1.0 (2015-01-03)\n - enable npm install.\n \n### 0.0.9 (2014-11-22)\n - Support of new naming concept.\n \n### 0.0.8 (2014-10-31)\n - Fix names of classes.\n\n### 0.0.6 (2014-10-30)\n - Show in config found tty ports.\n \n### 0.0.3 (2014-10-30)\n - Classify channels.\n\n### 0.0.2 (2014-10-28)\n - Initial commit.
